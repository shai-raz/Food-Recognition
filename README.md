# Food Recognition
 Food recgonition using basic CNN
<br />

A jupyter notebook used to train a model to classify 5 different foods using a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).<br />
The dataset is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41 (using Falafel, French Fries, Ice Cream, Pancakes and Pizza images).<br />
Each class (food) has 1000 different images in it.<br />
<br />
The model is able to predict a new sample with 81% accuracy,<br />
which is a rather nice result with such a simple NN.
